Project: Developing a new generation of jetting 3D printer
Responsibility: The entire project (Working alone on it)

Work done:  
 	Reading & understanding the documentation of a 2D ink printhead
	Implementation of all the functionalities to control it
o	Ignition sequence
o	Power supply
o	Ink supply (pressure system) (for resin instead of ink)
o	Control of the nozzles 
	Creation of an electronic card to easily control the 2D printhead with an ESP32
 	Using an already working 3D PLA Printer with an open-source mother board
	Learning the G-Code to control the 3D printer
	Implementation inside the 3D printer
o	Of the 2D Printhead
o	Of a resin supply system
o	Of a UV light to solidify the resin 
 	Creation of a Slicer
	From a 3D file (.STL format)
o	Generation of a G-Code file (based on the number of slices)
o	Generation of a specific file for the 2D Printhead to eject drops of resin
 

Results achieved:
 	The entire system was working after 3 months
 	First 3D impressions were done easily
 	The next step was to add others printhead to mix different resins but due to a lack of time, not implemented

	Chemical etching with iron chloride solution


SENSIVIC - Internship

Context: Due to the shortage of semiconductors, the company needs to change their microcontroller, from STM to ESP32
Project: Developing a solution based on ESP32 to create an acoustic antenna 
Responsibility: Full responsibility of the project
Goal: Sampling 4 microphones at 100 kHz to localize in the space the origin of a sound.

Work done:
 	Starting to use the ADC on simple microphone
	Due to the number of microphones that must work simultaneously, introduction to the DMA.
 	Implementation using MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) for having a frequency around 100kHz

Results achieved:
 	PoC at the end of the 2 months internship


Technical environment
Technologies:	C, MEMS, i2s protocol
Tools:	ESP-IDF
